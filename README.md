# Kobe Lemon's Geolocator Site

Hello! My name is Kobe Lemon and I am a Web Developer! I am currently going to school at Brigham Young University-Idaho, majoring in a **Bachelor's in Software Development**, with an emphasis in Full Stack Web Development. I am currently learning frontend development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some Python.

This site is my final project for my WDD 330 Web Frontend Development class. This is a site that uses the Geolocation API and the OpenWeather API to show your current static location, your current real time location, and the weather data for your current location.
